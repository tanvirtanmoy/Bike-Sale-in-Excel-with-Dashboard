### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of bikes, within the region of Europe, the Pacific, and the north america. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify the trends and make data-driven recommendations.

### Data Source
The primary data used for this data analysis is the "Bike_Sales_Dataset.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about the bike sales made by the company. 

### Tools
- Excel
  
### Data Cleaning
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Removing any duplicate data
3. Standardizing the data
4. Removing any null or missing values

### Exploratory Data Analysis using Pivot Tables
1. What is the income of the customers who bought bikes, compared to the ones who don't own a bike?
2. What role does the commute distance play while deciding to purchase a bike?
3. What role does the age of the customer play while deciding to purchase a bike?

### Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. People who purchase bikes have higher incomes compared to people who do not purchase bikes
2. When the commute distance is more than 5 miles, the rate of purchasing bikes substantially reduces
3. People within the age group of 31 to 54 are more likely to purchase a bike, compared to the younger or older age groups

### Recommendation
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
1. Try to focus the marketing and promotions on individuals who have higher incomes, above $54,000 for females and above $58,000 for males.
2. Try to focus the promotion on people who usually need to travel for shorter commute distances, less than 5 miles.
3. Try to focus the promotion on people aged between 31 to 54 years.
